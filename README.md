# Water-Reservoir-Problem
The code is for the Mula reservoir project 
The algorithm used to solve are Particle Swarm optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), 
Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artifical Bee Colony (ABC), Cuckoo Search (CS) and Simulated Annealing (SA)

# How to run the Code
Run the code from the optimizationDemo file, which calls, all the algorithm from the function and 
will output the results and the convergence plot for different algorithms.

The problem works for 1 year data, if you want to run for your analysis, please load the data and run the program.
Number of runs, number of iteraions, population size and number of variables can be change in the OptimizationDemo file
